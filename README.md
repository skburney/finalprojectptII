# Final Project Part II

## BTS - *How Inclusive is Their Diversity?*

### Revisions to Part I

After getting feedback from classmates and my professor on the direction of my project I started with my 'Call to Action' to help frame the rest of my project and overall message.  Once doing so, it made my organization of information and data much more manageable.  Some of the feedback and suggestions for my 'Call to Action' was to tie my goal back to Heinz College.  This would then give who I am presenting to tangible action items within diversity and inclusion. 

I wanted to keep my original story arc (seen in Final Project Part I) that took the reader on a journey of emotions.  I wanted to keep it starting out neutral with definitions and then moving along.  

**Mediums Used**: Shorthand & Infogram

**Target Audience**: Heinz College members, but also wanted to make it open that anyone reading could have a general connection to the material

### Summary of Changes

- After creating a clear 'Call to Action', I first began by defining 'Diversity' & 'Inclusion' to help the reader understand what these meant.  
- Next, I wanted to show some statistics of the positives of having diversity within the workplace and why it matters. 
- Which led me to start combing through the many sources of data that I had and tried to focus on what mattered to getting my point across and how it connected to my 'Call of Action' of *How to be more inclusive at Heinz College*
- I started with a graphic that was related to basic career level and race that I found from [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/11/companies-are-making-bold-promises-about-greater-diversity-theres-a-long-way-to-go.html) and I reworked the graph to show this information has not changed
- After finalizing this graphic, I wanted to keep that negative feeling and show various companies and industries that struggle with diversity and inclusion.  Originally, I had an example on the NFL, Berkshire Hathaway and the entertainment industry. 
- However, after receiving feedback they all felt disconnected in a way and I cut it back to one example with the NFL.  And I essentially added the Tech industry as a focus, but only in a graphic.  This was tailored more towards my CMU audience. 
- I then moved my definition of Inclusion to a new and separate section since it is different from diversity and I wanted the reader to look at inclusion as the solution for what companies are lacking.  Doing this adding more context and true story to my presentation.  
- I then moved into my positive company example, AT&T, which was an example given to me by a fellow classmate.  I had so much data on AT&T's diversity efforts, but I wanted to hit on ones that everyone could connect to: Women, People of Color, People with Disabilities and the LGBTQ+ communities.  I focused on these because it is highly likely that anyone watching this presentation knows someone or is someone in one of these groups. 
- Then I created some visualizations that fit each of these categories and again kept them simple and added them to my presentation.  
- I then tied it all into my call to action and made sure it had a clear and distinct change.  
- Overall, I wanted the reader to feel informed and inspired to be a part of a change that impacts their friends, families and themselves. 

## Details on Graphics and Colors Used

For all of the graphics showcasing race, I wanted to ensure that the colors I was using were similar overall.  I like vibrant colors, but didn't want them to be overwhelming, so I stayed within the same family of purples.

For my company spotlight of AT&T, I wanted to use the Blue and green colors to differentiate throughout my presentation, but keep it connected.  

When I wanted the reader to feel positive, I tried sticking with a light blue that was offered in shorthand.  
For the more negative feelings I used a light red and for the transition from informative to negative, I used a bold deep red.  
When I wanted to highlight diversity and inclusion, I used a deep teal and a deep gold, respectively.  This was so the reader could understand that these two are different from each other and not the be confused into being the same. 

For showing women, I wanted to use pink as it is usually related to women.  For another graphic within AT&T, I went back to muted purple colors because I had POC and women represented and did not want to bring back that pink color and confuse the reader with a negative feeling.  I tied back to my more positive colors in the beginning of my presentation since I knew it would be difficult to use the exact same colors from before. 

# Moodboards

These are the colors for the overall mood and feel of my presentation.

### Final Graphics Used 

I created and edited all my graphics using Infogram.  I re-worked many of them by starting with simple information from my data sources and seeing how I could add more details without it being convoluted.  I then got feedback from my partner on if he understood the graphics without me having to explain them to him and from there, I made changes or used completely different graphs/charts.  

I felt like some of my charts are very simple, but if they are what the reader understands and connects to the most then that's what matters.

## References of Data Used for Final Project

Below is the link that combines all the data sources and websites that I used. The data I used was to help mentally illustrate: what diversity and inclusion are separately, how companies are struggling to capture this, a possible solution to this problem, an example of a company who has captured diversity and inclusion and how the reader can also become a part of the solution to an inclusive environment.
