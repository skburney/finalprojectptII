# Final Project Part II

## BTS - *How Inclusive is Their Diversity?*

### Revisions to Part I

After getting feedback from classmates and my professor on the direction of my project I started with my 'Call to Action' to help frame the rest of my project and overall message.  Once doing so, it made my organization of information and data much more manageable.  Some of the feedback and suggestions for my 'Call to Action' was to tie my goal back to Heinz College.  This would then give who I am presenting to tangible action items within diversity and inclusion. 

I wanted to keep my original story arc (seen in Final Project Part I) that took the reader on a journey of emotions.  I wanted to keep it starting out neutral with definitions and then moving along.  

### Summary of Changes

- After creating a clear 'Call to Action', I first began by defining 'Diversity' & 'Inclusion' to help the reader understand what these meant.  
- Next, I wanted to show some statistics of the positivitys of having diversity within the workplace and why it matters. 
- Which led me to start combing through the many sources of data that I had and tried to focus on what mattered to getting my point across and how it connected to my 'Call of Action' of *How to be more incluivse at Heinz College*
- I started with a graphic that was related to basic career level and race that I found from [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/11/companies-are-making-bold-promises-about-greater-diversity-theres-a-long-way-to-go.html) and I reworked the graph to show this information has not changed 


## Details on Graphics and Colors Used

For all of the graphics showcasing race, I wanted to ensure that the colors I was using were similar overall.  I like vibrant colors, but didn't want them to be overwhelming, so I stayed within the same family of purples.

For my company spotlight of AT&T, I wanted to used the Blue and green colors to differentate throughout my presentation, but keep it connected.  

When I wanted the reader to feel positive, I tried sticking with a light blue that was offered in shorthand.  
For the more negative feelings I used a light red and for the transisition from informaiton to negtaive, I used a bold deep red.  
When I wanted to highlight diversity and inclusion I used a deep teal and a deep gold, respectivley.  This was so the reader could understand that these two are different from each other and not the be confused into being the same. 

### Final Graphics Used 

I created and edited all of my graphics using Infogram.  I re-worked many of them by starting with simple information from my data sources and seeing how I could add more details without it being convoluted.  I then got feedback from my partner on if he understood the graphics without me having to explain them to him and from there I made changes or used completely different graphs/charts.  I felt like some of my charts are very simple, but if they are what the reader understands and connects to the most then that's what matters.
